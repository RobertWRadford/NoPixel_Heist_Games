# NoPixel_Heist_Games

I realized even after making a pretty large number of sites, I hadn't created anything with timed actions. While I was working I had also been keeping entertained on the side by watching content from the GTA V roleplay server NoPixel, and I thought some of the minigames might be perfect to reproduce in HTML/CSS/JS to practice timed elements. I was expecting to only spend one afternoon on this but I ended up spending two to get everything done. Some of the code layout is really sloppy and the aesthetics are very minimal effort but it functions entirely as desired.
